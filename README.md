A Python implementation of the moving average principal components analysis methods from GIFT

## Usage

**Please do not use this library.** The `mapca` library does not yet have a license, since it was developed from MATLAB code in another package without a license. We have contacted the MATLAB library's authors about licensing and will take the appropriate steps when we hear back from them. We have only made `mapca` public to make it easier to run CI.
